1. **Initialize Traque**

## Configuration

Traque is highly configurable and can be customized to meet your specific needs. After installation, you'll want to:

- Set up your environment variables
- Configure your tracking preferences
- Initialize the client

### Initialize Traque

Here's how to set up Traque in your project:

```typescript
import { Traque } from '@traque/core';

const traque = new Traque({
  apiKey: process.env.TRAQUE_API_KEY,
  serviceUrl: process.env.TRAQUE_SERVICE_URL,
});
```

**Environment Variables:**

Make sure to set up these environment variables in your project:

- `TRAQUE_API_KEY` - Your unique API key from the Traque dashboard
- `TRAQUE_SERVICE_URL` - The service URL for your Traque instance

**Cloud Version:**

If you want to use our cloud version, set your service URL to:

```dotenv
TRAQUE_SERVICE_URL=https://api.traque.dev
```

Note: Our cloud service and data storage is currently located in the US. We'll soon be adding EU servers and storage for better performance and data compliance in Europe.

Once initialized, you can start tracking errors and events right away!

## Mobile App

The Traque mobile app is only available when using our cloud version. If you're running your own instance, you'll need to use the web dashboard for monitoring and notifications.

With the mobile app, you can:

- Get real-time notifications for errors and events
- Monitor your app's health on the go
- View detailed analytics and insights
- Collaborate with your team from anywhere
