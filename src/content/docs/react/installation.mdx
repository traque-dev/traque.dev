# Installation

You can install the Traque React SDK using your preferred package manager:

```package-install
@traque/react
```

## Requirements

- React 16.8+ (for Hooks support)
- @traque/core package (installed automatically as a dependency)

## Initial Setup

After installing the package, you'll need to initialize the Traque client and wrap your application with the `TraqueProvider`. Here's a basic setup:

```tsx
import { Traque } from '@traque/core';
import { TraqueProvider } from '@traque/react';

// Initialize the Traque client
const traque = new Traque({
  serviceUrl: 'https://your-service-url.com',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  environment: 'PRODUCTION',
});

function App() {
  return (
    <TraqueProvider traque={traque}>
      <YourApp />
    </TraqueProvider>
  );
}
```

### Configuration Options

When initializing the Traque client, you can provide several configuration options:

| Option        | Type    | Description                                              | Required |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `serviceUrl`  | string  | The URL of your Traque service endpoint                  | Yes      |
| `apiKey`      | string  | Your Traque API key                                      | Yes      |
| `environment` | string  | The environment name (e.g., 'PRODUCTION', 'DEVELOPMENT') | No       |
| `release`     | string  | The release version of your application                  | No       |
| `debug`       | boolean | Enable debug mode for additional logging                 | No       |

## Next Steps

Once you have installed and set up the Traque React SDK, you can:

1. Set up [Error Boundaries](/react/basic-usage#error-boundaries) to catch and report React component errors
2. Use the [useTraque hook](/react/basic-usage#manual-error-reporting) for manual error reporting
3. Configure additional error tracking features
