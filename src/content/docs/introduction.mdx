# Welcome to Traque

Traque is a tracking tool that keeps you updated about your app's health and what your users are doing, no matter where you are. We make app monitoring easy by combining AWS WAF integration with a mobile app that you can use anywhere.

## What is Traque?

Traque helps dev teams keep an eye on their apps. We track both errors and events in real-time, then send all the important info straight to your phone. You'll always know how your app is doing and what your users are up to.

Here's what you get:

- Error tracking and monitoring
- Real-time event tracking and analytics
- AWS WAF integration for better security
- Mobile app so you can check things on the go
- Instant notifications for errors and events
- Easy-to-read analytics and insights

## Why Traque?

Most tracking tools make you sit at your computer all day. That's not how we do. With Traque, you get all the important information about errors and user events right on your phone. Here's why that's awesome:

- No need to be stuck at your desk to watch your app
- Get notified the moment something goes wrong or something cool happens
- Check detailed data while you're out and about
- See what users are doing in real-time
- Fix problems faster and understand your users better
- Work with your team right from your phone

We're always adding new tracking features and integrations to make monitoring your app even easier and more useful.

As we continue to evolve, we're constantly expanding our tracking capabilities and adding new integrations to make your application monitoring experience even more comprehensive and efficient.

## Real-Life Use Cases

Traque is super helpful when you want to get notified about important moments in your app. Here are some real examples of what dev teams track:

**Business Events:**

- New user sign ups (especially from specific marketing campaigns)
- High-value purchases or subscription upgrades
- User achievements (like completing onboarding or reaching usage limits)
- Payment failures that need immediate attention

**Technical Alerts:**

- API errors that could affect user experience
- Database connection issues before they become critical
- Server performance problems or unusual traffic spikes
- Security alerts like suspicious login attempts

**Team Coordination:**

- When someone deploys new code to production
- Feature usage milestones (like "1000 users tried the new feature!")
- User feedback or support requests that need quick responses
- System maintenance windows starting or ending

Instead of constantly checking dashboards or waiting for users to report problems, you get notified the moment something important happens. Whether it's celebrating a new customer or fixing a critical bug, Traque keeps your team in the loop.
