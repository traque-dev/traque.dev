# Event Tracking

Event tracking lets you monitor what users do in your app. Unlike error tracking that only captures problems, event tracking shows you all the good stuff - user interactions, feature usage, custom milestones, and more.

## What Are Events?

Events are actions or moments that happen in your app. Each event has two parts:

1. **Name** - A simple string that describes what happened
2. **Properties** - Any additional data you want to include (as an object)

Examples of events you might track:

- User login
- Button clicks
- Page views
- Purchase completed
- Feature used
- Custom business events

## How to Track Events

Use the `captureEvent` method to track events in your app:

```typescript
traque.captureEvent('event_name', {
  field: 'value',
});
```

### Real Examples

Here are some practical examples:

```typescript
// Track user login
traque.captureEvent('user_login', {
  userId: 'user123',
  method: 'email',
});

// Track button click
traque.captureEvent('button_click', {
  buttonName: 'subscribe',
  page: 'pricing',
});

// Track purchase
traque.captureEvent('purchase_completed', {
  amount: 29.99,
  plan: 'pro',
  currency: 'USD',
});

// Track feature usage
traque.captureEvent('feature_used', {
  feature: 'export_data',
  fileType: 'csv',
});
```

## Event Properties

You can include any data in the properties object:

- **Strings** - user IDs, page names, categories
- **Numbers** - amounts, counts, scores
- **Booleans** - flags, success/failure states
- **Objects** - nested data structures
- **Arrays** - lists of items

```typescript
traque.captureEvent('complex_event', {
  userId: 'user123',
  count: 42,
  success: true,
  metadata: {
    source: 'mobile_app',
    version: '2.1.0',
  },
  tags: ['premium', 'beta'],
});
```

## Event Notifications

Just like with errors, you can get notified when specific events happen. Depending on your notification trigger settings, you can receive:

- **Push notifications** on your phone
- **Email alerts** sent to your inbox
- **Discord messages** in your team channel

You can set up custom triggers based on:

- Specific event names
- Property values
- Event frequency
- User segments

For example, you might want to get notified when:

- A user upgrades to premium
- Someone uses a new feature
- Daily active users hit a milestone

## Event Analytics

All your events show up in Traque's analytics dashboard where you can:

- See event trends over time
- Filter by properties
- Create custom charts
- Track user journeys
- Measure feature adoption
